## ESX_EDEN_GARAGE - Version 1.0

[Official FiveM link] N/A

This is the **latest version** of my edit of ESX_EDEN_GARAGE. I apologize for the low frequency of updates.
**This is an Edit**

##Requirment:
* ESX_VehicleShop

**Whats Different?**
* No markers
* All One Menu

1)Use the My SQL provided
2)Put the resource in your server.cfg
3)Edit the config to add garages or edit the ones I've added.

KNOWN BUGS:
- You have to be outside of your car to store it.
- If you exit the menu early you have to leave the area and come back again

I'm working on fixes for both.


## Thank you very much
